# Pixel Art Maker Project

Users should be able to:

1. Dynamically set the size of the table as an N by M grid.

2. Choose a color.

3. Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.

4. The primary task is to implement the makeGrid() function, that dynamically creates a grid that the user can interact with.
